# DungeonProject
A small Android text based dungeon game.
Made by Jocelyn Ting, Josh Fuentes, Juan Rivera, and Richard Powell

Use the arrows to move around the player '@'.
Pressed the interact key to interact with items '$' or enemies.

Items and Modifiers are randomly generated and add to the stats of the player.
(There are over 300 Item+Modifier combinations!)

Defeat the enemy of the map to get to the doors '#'.
Interact with the doors to move to the next map and gain more powerful items.
However, if an enemy defeats you, you'll have to restart the game all over!

On the last map, there is a boss. Defeat the boss with all of your weapons and armor
and win the game!
